# LangChain - Movie Recommendation System

LangChain is a powerful open-source framework designed to help developers build LLM-powered applications quickly and efficiently. It allows for chaining multiple steps, managing conversation context, integrating with vector databases, and building intelligent agents.

##  Features
-  Uses vector similarity to retrieve movie info from a CSV file
-  Processes natural language questions using a local LLM (via Ollama)
-  Vector storage powered by FAISS
-  Embeddings generated using HuggingFace (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
-  No internet required
